# Fullstack Open by University of Helsinki

This repository contains my solutions for the Fullstack Open course exercises. The course covers a wide range of web development topics, from basics to more advanced techniques.

## Overview

The Fullstack Open course is offered by the University of Helsinki and covers modern web development with JavaScript. The course is divided into several parts, each focusing on different aspects of web development.

## Parts Completed

### Part 0: Fundamentals of Web Apps

- **Technologies Used**: 
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - Browser DevTools

Part 0 introduces the basics of web development, including how the web works, HTTP requests, and basic HTML and CSS.

### Part 1: Introduction to React

- **Technologies Used**: 
  - React
  - JavaScript (ES6+)
  - JSX

### Part 2: Communicating with Server

- **Technologies Used**: 
  - React
  - JavaScript (ES6+)
  - Axios
  - JSON Server
  - Promises and async/await

Part 2 dives into how to communicate with a server in a React application. It covers REST APIs, using Axios for HTTP requests, and handling asynchronous operations with Promises and async/await.

### Part 4: Testing Express servers, user administration

- **Technologies Used**: 
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - MongoDB
  - Mongoose
  - Jest
  - Supertest
  - bcrypt
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Part 4 covers backend development with Node.js and Express. It includes setting up a MongoDB database with Mongoose, user authentication with bcrypt and JWT, and testing with Jest and Supertest.

### Part 5: Testing React apps

- **Technologies Used**: 
  - React
  - Jest
  - React Testing Library
  - Cypress

Part 5 focuses on testing React applications. It covers unit testing with Jest, component testing with React Testing Library, and end-to-end testing with Cypress.
